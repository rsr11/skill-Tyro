            <li>•	Classes are conducted daily (except on holidays, as decided by the Institute). Students are expected to attend all classes as per their schedule. 80% attendance is mandatory for all students.

Also, if 80% of the number of classes is not a whole number, the required number of classes will be rounded up to the next highest integer value. For example, if the total working days were 44, then 80% of 44 classes is 35.2 classes - which means that the student is required to attend a minimum of 36 classes.</li>
            <li>•	Further, all students are to reach their class on time. If a class starts at 9:00 AM, students may be denied entry after 9:05 AM i.e. the student will be marked absent for that day.</li>
            <li>•	If a student wants a leave on a working day, he/she can apply for the same by submitting a written application to the facilitator.</li>
            <li>•	This has to be done at least 1 day in advance. The student should attach all documents supporting his/her leave application such as medical certificates, wedding cards, etc. Leave will be granted at the discretion of the facilitator.</li>
            <li>•	In case of any emergency due to which the student failed to submit his/her leave application in advance, it is mandatory to submit the leave application on the next day.</li>
            <li>•	Hence, the student may be:</li>

            </ol>
            <li>•	If a student is absent without leave granted by the facilitator for 3 consecutive days or more than 5% of the total working days, disciplinary action will be initiated against him/her. This involves sending official communication to the parents of the student, formal submission of reason statements, an apology by the student and parents as applicable, and can eventually result in rustication of the student.</li>
            <li>•	SkillTyro Institute reserves the right to rusticate, withhold the results, and deny certification(s) to the students who fail to comply with the Attendance policy.</li>

           <p class="mt-5">Students may be sent by the SkillTyro Institute for an Internship to one of the industry partners.

This can also mean that the student has to work during the night shift. The student will have no right in rejecting either the Industry Partner, location or shift, and will have to go for the Internship assigned by the Institute. Failure to comply can have serious consequences of the level of rustication. The Institute will not entertain any negotiations regarding the change of assigned Internship. During the Internship, students are expected to maintain the highest level of discipline & show the utmost level of respect to the industry partner.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">Certain students will not be allowed to go on Internship, such as:</p>
           <ol class="mt-5">
            <li>1.	If they have failed any of their exams.</li>
            <li>2.	If they have any outstanding dues payable to SkillTyro Institute in form of fees/fines/security deposits/charges etc.</li>
            <li>3.	If they have failed to receive the “No Dues” certificate from the Institute.</li>
            <li>4.	If they have not met their mentor as per schedule.</li>
            <li>5.	If they have failed to demonstrate the discipline expected of each SkillTyro student.</li>
            <li>6.	If they are considered psychologically or technically unfit for training.</li>
            <li>7.	If they have not completed the ‘Internship Preparation Training’ provided by the Placement Cell.</li>
            <li>8.	If they have not passed the ‘Internship Preparation Training’ provided by the Placement Cell.</li>
            <li>9.	If they fail to be present for the Internship interview on the assigned date with the Industry Partner</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="mt-5">Further, a student may even be rusticated from SkillTyro Institute if, during the Internship:</p>
           <ol class="mt-5">
            <li>1.	He/she misbehaves with any employee/ customer of the Industry Partner.</li>
            <li>2.	He/she has an unauthorized leave of absence from the Internship.</li>
            <li>3.	He/she fails to perform his/ her duties as per the expectations of the Industry Partner.</li>
            <li>4.	He/she violates any policies of the Industry Partner.</li>
            <li>5.	He/she causes harm to the property/reputation etc. of the Industry Partner.</li>
            <li>6.	He/she causes harm to the reputation of the Institute.</li>
            <li>7.	He/she refuses to attend and drops out of the assigned Internship.</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="mt-5">If a student faces any issues during the Internship, he/she is expected to report them to the Placement Cell at SkillTyro Institute. Once the student has informed of an issue, he/she must wait for further instructions from SkillTyro Institute and must continue to attend work as per assignment, unless doing so is illegal or unfeasible for any reason.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">The student can also reach out to his/her mentor as SkillTyro Institute is fully committed to providing all possible support to all students.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">At the end of the Internship, all students will have to submit the following:</p>
           <ol class="mt-5">
            <li>1.	A logbook and an Internship Report on what they did & learned during their Internship.</li>
            <li>2.	The logbook must be signed by the direct supervisor at the Industry Partner.</li>
            <li>3.	Internship Certificate from the employer with employer sign and stamp.</li>
            <li>4.	Filled Employer Feedback Form with employer sign and stamp.</li>
            <li>5.	Filled Student Feedback Form.</li>
            <li>6.	Filled Internship Daily Attendance Form with employer sign and stamp.</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="mt-5">If either of the above is missing, the student will be considered to have failed the Internship and will not be awarded a Certificate/Diploma/Advanced Diploma, etc. No second chance will be given to a student to make up for a failed Internship. Such students will be considered to have failed their Program.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">SkillTyro Institute reserves the right to rusticate, withhold the results, and deny certification(s) to the students who fail to meet any of the Internship requirements.</p>

           <h2 class="mt-10 underline text-lg font-semibold">Placement Policy</h2>
           <p class="mt-5">Placement Cell will actively support and coordinate with the Academic Department in providing guidance and support to the students for their self-grooming and to bring the best possible opportunities for Campus Placements for the students.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">Placement Cell will be a composite department, consisting of the Institute’s staff and students, formed under the recommendation of the Institute’s Management.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">The Placement events/Interview calls will be notified to the students through posts on WhatsApp groups, or other social media, SMS’s, myCareer notifications, or personal mails. These notices will also be posted on the Institute’s notice board. The Placement Cell may also employ additional parallel systems like phone calls or class announcements, which will only be a supplementary system and not necessarily an assured mode of communication.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">To augment the placement activities, a team of students will be formed giving adequate representation to all Programs. The selection of this team will be done as per the suggestions given by the FIC.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">The contentious issues, problems, grievances, or matters involving policy changes will be referred to the Institute’s Management through the Placement Cell.</p>
           <p class="mt-5">Certain students may be debarred from the SkillTyro Institute Placement pool and SkillTyro Institute reserves the right to withhold the results and deny certification(s) to the students who fail to meet any of the Placement requirements: </p>
           <ol class="mt-5">
            <li>1.	Once the candidates are shortlisted as per the criteria received from the recruiting organization, they will have to attend the next round, whether PI, GD or any other. Absent students will be debarred from further placement support. The student may be allowed to withdraw from the selection process of a particular organization only if a valid reason is furnished by the student through a written application submitted to the Placement Cell before receiving an offer of employment. The student may then be allowed to attend the forthcoming Placement process. However, the student will have to furnish a written undertaking that he withdrew from the placement process & any waiver will be at the discretion of the Institute.</li>
            <li>2.	If the offer from the recruiter is received, and the student refuses to join the company, he/she will be removed from the placement list and will not be given another opportunity for placement. This provision is in the interest of all students to avoid wasting available vacancies and maintain a good relationship with the recruiters.</li>
            <li>3.	Students must adhere to the norms of discipline and personal conduct during their interactions with recruiters. Any misconduct will attract disciplinary action which may result in students being permanently debarred from the placement process.</li>
            <li>4.	The Institute’s Placement Cell will strive to provide further support to its alumni to enhance their careers by suggesting job opportunities to them. However, for this, it is mandatory for the student to work for at least 6 months with the company that they are currently working with. They must also maintain good relations with their previous employer and quit the job only as per employer policies. If any of these conditions are not met, continued support shall not be provided by the Institute.</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="mt-5">The student must provide the below placement proofs to the SkillTyro Institute to get their certification:</p>
           <ol class="mt-5">
            <li>1.	Offer Letter from employer with employer sign and stamp</li>
            <li>2.	Salary Slips - a minimum of 3 months</li>
            <li>3.	Bank Statements - a minimum of 3 months</li>
            <li>4.	Filled Employer Feedback Form with employer sign and stamp</li>
            <li>5.	Filled Student Feedback Form</li>
           </ol>
